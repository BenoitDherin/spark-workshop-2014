These instructions are for setting up your Amazon web services class account.

1) Using the information in the email sent to your @berkeley.edu account (namely the username and password and the URL to login to), login to AWS and change your password.

2) Go to Services and select S3 under Storage and Content Delivery.

3) Navigate through the directory structure to the folder for your account.
All Buckets / spark-workshop-2014-<some digits> / home / <your_username>

4) Download the spark-workshop-2014-credentials.boto file and the spark-workshop-2014-ssh_key.pem file to your local computer. You'll need to select each file and then choose "Actions -> Download".

5) DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT in any way make the credentials in the spark-workshop-2014-credentials.boto public in any way. In particular do not put them into a public Github repository. One of the students in my Stat243 class did this, and hackers started up a bunch of instances in the AWS account and cost us about $700 in credits before we realized what was happening.
